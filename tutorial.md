# Web.go tutorial

## Getting started

For installation insructions, check out the [quickstart guide](index.html).

This is the classic hello world web application, written in Go, which this tutorial often references:

{% highlight go %}
package main

import (
    "github.com/aisk/web"
)

func hello(val string) string { 
    return "hello " + val 
} 

func main() {
    web.Get("/(.*)", hello)
    web.Run("0.0.0.0:9999")
}
{% endhighlight %}

## URL Handling

An important part of web applications is knowing how to respond to a given URL path. Web.go provides several methods to add handlers based on a route pattern. These include:

* [web.Get](/api.html#Get) adds a handler for the most common GET method. It takes two parameters: a regular expression containing the pattern to match, and a function that handles the response.
* [web.Post](/api.html#Post) adds a handler for the POST method, with a signature similar to `web.Get`.
* [web.Put](/api.html#Put) and [web.Delete](/api.html#Delete) can be used to handle the PUT and DELETE methods.
* [web.Match](/api.html#Match) can match arbitrary HTTP methods. It takes three arguments - the first is the method name, the second is the path regular expression, and the third is the handler.

### Route handlers

In the hello example above, HTTP requests with paths that match the regular expression `/(.*)` are appllied to the following function:

{% highlight go %}
func hello(val string) string { 
    return "hello " + val 
} 
{% endhighlight %}

Because of the wildcard regular expression, everything after the `/` in the path is passed to the argument _val_ in the hello function. A handler function is required to have the same number of arguments as regular expression groups in its url pattern. 

Although handlers usually return a string, web.go also accepts handler functions that have no return value. These methods are responsible for writing data to the response directly. The following example is equivalent to the one before it:

{% highlight go %}
package main

import (
    "github.com/aisk/web"
)

func hello(ctx *web.Context, val string) { 
    ctx.WriteString("hello " + val)
} 

func main() {
    web.Get("/(.*)", hello)
    web.Run("0.0.0.0:9999")
}
{% endhighlight %}

Writing to the context variable is explained in detail in a later section.  

## The web.Context type

Any handler in web.go can optionally have a pointer to a `web.Context` struct as its first argument. This object contains information about the request and provides methods to control the response. 

Here is a brief summary of the fields in [web.Context](/api.html#Context):

* `ctx.Request` is a struct of type [http.Request](http://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Request) which can be use to retrieve details about the HTTP request, including the params, headers, and files.
* `ctx.Params` is a map\[string\]string that contains the request parameters. This is a flattened version of ctx.Request.Form, and is available for convenience.
* `ctx.ResponseWriter` is the [http.ResponseWriter](http://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#ResponseWriter) for the connection. Use it to set the response code, headers, or write to the body.
* `ctx.Server` is the [web.Server](/api.html#Server) object of the current conection. It contains the configuration details of the server.

A web.Context object gives you access to the HTTP response and lets you set a status code, set response headers, and write to the connection directly.

### Setting a response code

Set the status code of an HTTP response by using [ctx.WriteHeader](/api.html#Context). This method takes a numeric status code as an argument. There are also several convinience methods that set the status code:

* [ctx.NotFound](/api.html#Context.NotFound) is used to return an error message along with a 404 status code.
* [ctx.Abort](/api.html#Context.Abort) takes a status code and message as arguments. It is useful for 5xx error messages.
* [ctx.Redirect](/api.html#Context.Redirect) is commonly used to send 301 or 302 redirects to a url.
* [ctx.NotModified](/api.html#Context.NotModified) sets a 304 status code.

You can also set any arbitrary header code using `ctx.WriteHeader(code)`. 

You should only call ctx.WriteHeader once. After it is called, setting additional HTTP response headers will have no effect.

### Setting response headers

There is a convenience method on web.Context, `SetHeader`, that can be used to set HTTP response headers. The first
two parameters are the header key and value, and the last parameter, `unique`, is a boolean that determines whether
existing values for this header should be overwritten.

You can also call `Header` on the to get the actual response header map. This has methods `Add` and `Set` that can be used to set the HTTP headers as well. When `WriteHeader` is called, this map is included in the response.

{% highlight go %}
package main

import (
    "github.com/aisk/web"
)

func hello(ctx *web.Context, val string) string {
    ctx.SetHeader("X-Powered-By", "web.go", true)
    ctx.SetHeader("X-Frame-Options", "DENY", true)
    ctx.SetHeader("Connection", "close", true)
    return "hello " + val 
} 

func main() {
    web.Get("/(.*)", hello)
    web.Run("0.0.0.0:9999")
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Setting cookies

web.Context has a method `SetCookie` that takes an http.Cookie object and sets it as a response header. It is often used in conjunction with the helper method web.NewCookie. For example, the following code is a modified hello world example that sets a permanent cookie in the response. The last parameter of `NewCookie` determines the age of the cookie.

{% highlight go %}
package main

import (
    "github.com/aisk/web"
)

func hello(ctx *web.Context, val string) string {
    ctx.SetCookie(web.NewCookie("value", val, 0))
    return "hello " + val 
} 

func main() {
    web.Get("/(.*)", hello)
    web.Run("0.0.0.0:9999")
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Writing to the body

Web.go gives you the ability to write the body connection directly using `Write` and `WriteString` on web.Context. `WriteHeader(200)` will be called during the first call to `Write` unless it has previously been called. 

A `web.Context` object can be used as an `io.Writer` interface. It is useful writing an `io.Reader` object into the body of an HTTP response. This comes up when often writing the contents of a buffer to the response, or when writing the contents of a file or pipe.

{% highlight go %}
package main

import (
    "bytes"
    "github.com/aisk/web"
    "io"
)

func hello(ctx *web.Context, val string) {
    var buf bytes.Buffer
    buf.WriteString("hello " + val)
    //copy buf directly into the HTTP response
    io.Copy(ctx, &buf)
} 

func main() {
    web.Get("/(.*)", hello)
    web.Run("0.0.0.0:9999")
}
{% endhighlight %}

Using `ctx.Write`, web.go allows you to maintain long-running HTTP connections and send back results periodically. See the [streaming example](https://github.com/aisk/web/blob/master/examples/streaming.go) for more details.

Note, when calling `ctx.Write` and `ctx.WriteString`, the content will be buffered until the handler has completed. Many ResponseWriter objects have a `Flush` method that can be used to flush the content into the HTTP connection. An example of this is also available in the [streaming example](https://github.com/aisk/web/blob/master/examples/streaming.go).

## Templates

Templating libraries are very when rendering HTML in web applications. Web.go doesn't include a templating library. However, there are several good ones available, such as [Go's http/template library](http://golang.org/pkg/html/template/) or [mustache](http://github.com/hoisie/mustache).

## Static Files

Web.go has the ability to serve static files in a very efficient way. If you place files in the `static` directory of your web application, web.go will serve them if a request matches the name of the file.

For example, if you have a web app in `$HOME/app` being served from `myapp.com`, and there's a file `$HOME/app/static/image.jpg`, requesting `myapp.com/image.jpg` will serve the static file. A common practice is to have `static/images`, `static/stylesheets`, and `static/javascripts` that contain static files. 

Note that Web.go is looking for the `static` directory in both the directory where the web app is located and your current working directory. You can also change web.ServerConfig.StaticDir to specify a directory.

## Shared hosts

Web.go provides methods to run web applications using the SCGI or FastCGI protocols. This
enables web.go apps to run in shared hosts environments. 

These methods are similar to web.Run:

* web.RunScgi(addr) serves SCGI requests. (example below)
* web.RunFcgi(addr) serves FastCGI requests.
* web.RunTLS(addr, tlsContext) serves HTTPS request. See the [example](https://github.com/aisk/web/blob/master/examples/tls.go) for details.

For instance, to serve the hello example above running Scgi, just write the following:

{% highlight go %}
package main

import (
    "github.com/aisk/web"
)

func hello(val string) string { 
    return "hello " + val 
} 

func main() {
    web.Get("/(.*)", hello)
    web.RunScgi("0.0.0.0:6580")
}
{% endhighlight %}

Next you need to configure your web server to pass requests along to port 6580. 

## Developing web.go

If you have an issue you'd like to debug in web.go, you'll want to modify the source code of the project.

By default, when you run `go get package`, the installer will fetch the source code and install the package in the directory specified by `$GOPATH`. If `$GOPATH` is not set, the library is installed in the `$GOROOT/pkg` folder, which defaults to where Go is built. As a developer of Go libraries, it is much more convenient to set a `$GOPATH` variable to a location like `$HOME/golibs` or `$HOME/projects/golibs`. See [how to write Go code](http://golang.org/doc/code.html) for more details. The first step to developing web.go is to ensure that you have an appropriate `$GOPATH` with two sub-directories: `src` and `pkg`. 

Next, you should run `cd $GOPATH/src && git clone github.com/aisk/web`. This creates a clone of the web.go repo in `$GOPATH/src/web`. Next, run `cd GOPATH/src/web && go install`. This will install the `web` package into `$GOPATH/pkg`. 

From now on, if you include web.go, you should use `import web`, and this will link to the files that are in `$GOPATH/pkg`. You can now modify the web.go source code in `$GOPATH/src/web`, rebuild with `go install`, and then rebuild your target appication.
